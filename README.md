# Static-Jade-Boilerplate
Vanilla boilerplate for static sites using Jade, Sass and Gulp. The aim is to stay simple while providing a solid foundation to kickstart static jade projects.

## Includes:
  - gulp tasks for compiling Jade to HTML, Sass to CSS, concatenate JS and Browser Sync for development

  - a scaffolding structure for building statics sites using templates, includes, mixins and data-files
